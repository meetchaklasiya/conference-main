          The International Conference on Oil & Gas for Energy Security (ICOGES) is to be organized by the Department of Petroleum Engineering, School of Energy Technology, Pandit Deendayal Energy University (PDEU) India. PDEU is a preeminent centre for energy studies and related technical disciplines.
          The two-day conference aims to facilitate the convergence of academicians, policymakers, regulators, innovators, oil and gas corporations, infrastructure firms, technology providers, industry experts, and investors. The event will serve as a platform for these diverse stakeholders to share their insights, offer stimulus, and contribute to the discourse around energy security.
          Mission, attests to India's intent to access to affordable energy sources, which is essential for a nation's economic stability and overall well-being. And expected to press on some of the crucial notes on Diversification of Energy Sources, Reliable Energy Supply, Energy Transition Challenges, Economic Impact, Geopolitical Considerations, Technological Advances, and Resilience to Disasters, Environmental Concerns, and Energy Security Strategies.

        <div className="about-para-container">
          <p>The provision of immediate, reliable, and cost-effective access to oil and gas is an essential requirement for the well-being of an expanding worldwide populace. To sustain a growing population, it is imperative to move towards an energy system mostly reliant on renewable sources, while simultaneously mitigating the remaining carbon emissions. This transition is crucial for ensuring the habitability of our planet in the long run.</p>
